# AXE Audio Mirror
Mirror of my AXE Audio project to make the codebase easier to find. This doesn't include the major portions of my other project (Shadow Engine) that AXE is dependent on, but all of that can be found [here](https://github.com/77Z/Shadow-Native).

# Where can I find the real one?

# What's this project all about?

This is a digital audio workstation written in C++, uses ImGui for the UI, and miniaudio for playback.
